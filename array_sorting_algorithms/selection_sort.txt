SELECTION SORT
##############

Selection sort is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm that iterates through the list to ensure every element at index i is the smallest/largest element of the list. 

See codepen for example.

BIG O ANALYSIS
It has an O(n^2) time complexity, which makes it inefficient on large lists.

The if statement if(smallestElem > arr[j]) has straightforward constant time complexity of O(1).

Count how many times the statement is executed:
- the outer loop runs n times with n being the length of the array
- the inner loop runs n-1 times
- thus we get n(n-1) or n^2 - n
- ignore non-dominant factor, result: O(n^2) or time complexity of O-squared
