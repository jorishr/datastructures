LINKED LIST
###########

A linked list is an ordered collection of data but the nodes are NOT stored in a sequential order, they can be found at unrelated memory allocations.

A list of data points is linked together with pointers. Each data point or NODE has a POINTER that points to the next value or node in the list.

The very first node is the HEAD, the TAIL or last node has a pointer value of NULL.

Thus each NODE consists of the actual DATA plus a REFERENCE or pointer.

You can create a class with methods to traverse the node list.
