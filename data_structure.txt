LISTS, SETS AND BAGS

Lists have a defined order and can allow duplicate values.
A set is unordered and does NOT allow duplicates. Values in a set have an index position and when adding a duplicate value, the original one gets overwritten.
A bag is an unordered collection of values that DOES allow for duplicates.

SQL, for example, is based on the bag algebra. Thus if you want a database to provide order or to remove duplicates that datasbase has to perform calculation as that 'bag' does not have order by default and allows duplicates.
