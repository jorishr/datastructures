HEAPS
#####

A heap is a special type of tree.

In a min heap all parent nodes are smaller than their child nodes. The root node is always the smallest number.

In a max heap all parent nodes are bigger than their child nodes. The root node is always the biggest number.

INSERTION (min heap)
The order: top to bottom, left to right. If the insert point is not the correct one you can bubble sort up the heap by comparing to the parent node.

IMPLEMENTATION
There are no gaps in a heap. Thus we can map it to an index based array.

The heap positions are as follows:
				0
		1				2
	3		4		5		6
7		8

Thus [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,...]

The parentNode index position of any other index position can be found: 

parentIndex = index - 1 / 2

The left child index position can be found: (parentIndex * 2) + 1 
The right child index position can be found:(parentIndex * 2) + 2
